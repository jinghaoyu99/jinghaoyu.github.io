<h3>About me</h3>
  
<p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en" target="_blank">Yau mathematical sciences center</a> (YMSC), 
  Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. My advisor is <a href="http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/cn/content/show/170-70.html">Zhengyu Zong</a>.
  From 2017 to 2021, I was a undergraduate student at <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en" target="_blank">
  Southern University of Science and Technology</a> (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. I received my bachelor at SUSTech in 2021.
  My bachelor academic advisor is <a href="https://yifeizhu.github.io/" target="_blank">Yifei Zhu</a>. My bachelor 
  thesis advisor is <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/c/huangshaochuang?lang=en" target="_blank">Shaochuang Huang</a>. </p>

 <h3>Research Interest</h3>
   
 <p>My research interests are in geometry, topology, mathematical physics, and related fields. My major interest is Gromov-Witten theory and related mirror 
   symmetry. Roughly speaking, Gromov-Witten invariants are the numbers of algebraic curves of various degree and genus lying on a variety. These invariants are defined
   by the cohomology classes on the moduli space of curves. Because we lack enough knowledge of the geometry of moduli space, the direct computation of 
   Gromov-Wittern invariants are difficult in general. Thus, we ask for find some other ways to do the calculation. </p>
   
  <p>There are several ways to do it: </p>
   <p>(1) The mirror symmetry links Gromov-Witten invariants of a manifold to the complex structure of its dual manifold. The phenomena of mirror symmetry are so rich
   that we use various phrases to describe them, for example, homological mirror symmetry, topological recursion and so on.</p>
   <p>(2) By virtual localization formula, the invariant are reduced to the computation of Hodge integrals. The later ones are related to HOMFLY polynomials.</p>
   
  <p>I am also interested in various topics of geometry and topology: like K-stability, birational geometry, TQFT.</p>
