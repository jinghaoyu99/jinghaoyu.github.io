<h3>About me</h3>
  
<p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/#" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics, 
  Tsinghua University</a> in Beijing, China. My advisor is Zhengyu Zong.
  From 2017 to 2021, I was an undergraduate student at <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en" target="_blank">
  Southern University of Science and Technology</a> (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. I received my bachelor's at SUSTech in 2021.
 </p>


 <h3>Research Interest</h3>
   
 <p>My research interest concentrates on Gromov-Witten theory and related fields. The Gromov-Witten theory
  is a virtual counting of curves on a manifold (orbifold). It is shown that the recursion relations in GW theory can be described by topological recursion, 
  which is a B-model in mirror symmetry. I am spending most of my time to find out explicit relations between them.

<!--   Beyond that, I am interested in other mathematics, like moduli space, and Schramm-Loewner evolution. -->
