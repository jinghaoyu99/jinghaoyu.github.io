<h2>Yifei Zhu</h2> 


<p>I'm an assistant professor at <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en" target="_blank">
  Southern University of Science and Technology</a> (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. 
  From 2013 to 2016, I was a visiting assistant professor at 
  <a href="https://www.math.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>. 
  I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://math.umn.edu/" target="_blank">
  University of Minnesota</a> in 2013. My advisor was 
  <a href="http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~tlawson/" target="_blank">
  Tyler Lawson</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests are in algebraic topology and related fields, 
  particularly in its connections to algebraic geometry and number theory via 
  objects such as formal groups, elliptic curves, and modular forms. 
  A central theme in my research is elliptic cohomology and power operations, 
  which combines the classical methodology of cohomological computations in 
  algebraic topology with modern inputs from arithmetic moduli of 
  elliptic curves in number theory.  More generally, I study moduli spaces in 
  various aspects, including geometric, arithmetic, computational, 
  combinatorial, and categorical.  I am also interested in applying topology to 
  physics and data science, such as signal processing through persistent homology.</p>
