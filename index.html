<h2>Jinghao Yu(余景浩)</h2> 


<p>From 2017 to 2021, I was a undergraduate student at <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en" target="_blank">
  Southern University of Science and Technology</a> (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. I received my bachelor at SUSTech in 2021.
  My academic advisor was <a href="https://yifeizhu.github.io/" target="_blank">Yifei Zhu</a>. My undergraduate 
  thesis advisor was <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/c/huangshaochuang?lang=en" target="_blank">Shaochuang Huang</a>. 
  From 2021.9 to now, I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en" target="_blank">Yau mathematical sciences center</a> (YMSC), 
  Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. My advisor is <a href="http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/cn/content/show/170-70.html">Zhengyu Zong</a>.</p>

 <p>My research interests are in geometry, topology, mathematical physics and related fields. I am learning Gromov-Witten theory
   and related mirror symmetry. I am also interested in algebraic geometry, especially K-stability and birational geometry. As a fresh 
   math PhD student, what I face is a broad ocean of unknown maths waited to be explored.</p>
