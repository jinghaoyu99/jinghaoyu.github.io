<h3>About me</h3>
  
<p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en" target="_blank">Yau mathematical sciences center</a> (YMSC), 
  Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. My advisor is <a href="http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/cn/content/show/170-70.html">Zhengyu Zong</a>.
  From 2017 to 2021, I was a undergraduate student at <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en" target="_blank">
  Southern University of Science and Technology</a> (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. I received my bachelor at SUSTech in 2021.

 <h3>Research Interest</h3>
   
 <p>My research interest concentrates on Gromov-Witten theory and related field. The Gromov-Witten theory is initiated from mathematical physics, which 
  is a virtual counting of curves on a manifold (orbifold). It is shown that the recursion relations in GW theory can be described by topologcial recursion, 
   which is a B-model in mirror symmetry. Meanwhile, topological recursion links many mathematical theory, including Hurwitz numbers, Weil-Peterson volume, HOMEFLY
  polynomials, random matrix theory and so on. I spend most of time to find out their explict relations. Beyond, I am interested in many mathematics, like 
  moduli space, complex geometry.</p>
